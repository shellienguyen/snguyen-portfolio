## Description:

This is a personal portfolio using HTML, CSS, React, React-bootstrap, and JavaScript.  The page shows a welcome page upon loading
and there are options for the user to view an "About Me" section, a Portfolio section listing a few finished
projects, a Resume section where the user can download the resume, and a Contact section as a way for the user to connect with
the site owner.
