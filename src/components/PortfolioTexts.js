      This is a task tracking site to help shelter employees/volunteers to track the
      dogs' daily activities.  The application tracks whether the dogs have been taken
      out for their twice-a-day walk and potty activities. The application also tracks
      by difficulty levels to make sure that all of the dogs are taken care of and paired
      with a compatible caretaker who meets the required experience.<br></br><br></br>
