      This is a task tracking site to help shelter employees/volunteers to track the
      dogs' daily activities.  The application tracks whether the dogs have been taken
      out for their twice-a-day walk and potty activities. The application also tracks
      by difficulty levels to make sure that all of the dogs are taken care of and paired
      with a compatible caretaker who meets the required experience.<br></br><br></br>

   <Card.Text>
      This is an application made for surfers in the OC/LA areas. It finds the current surf
      conditions for 7 tracked beaches along the OC/LA coastline, then returns a simplified
      layout of relevant surf and weather conditions for a user-selected beach. To add to
      a fun user experience, a relevant and random image that represents the current surf
      contidion is also displayed.<br></br><br></br>
